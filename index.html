<h1> Twentyone pilots </h1>
  <h2> no trespassing </h2>
  <h3> Your internet connection is down </h3>
  <h4> please check your internet </h4>
  <p> if not then dont bother us with your problems </p>
  <p> So now the tears in your jeans are the holes in your armor
You're the thoughts that I feared, you're the mountain I've conquered
If I told you I loved you, would you reach out and touch me?
You taste like the ocean and your body's disgusting
The only reason you breathe is to sleep through the night
The only reason you speak is to tell me I'm fine
The only reason you breathe is to sleep through the night
The only reason you speak is to state that you're mine
And my heart goes bum bum bum bum bum
 </p>
 <p>
   You said take the violin that you hang on your wall
Stick it under your bed before it crumbles and falls
Just don't open your eyes before counting to ten
I can hardly remember, just the smell of your hands
As they danced on my body, running over my pores
With the force of a steering wheel crushing my bones
I said you smell like the devil but you feel like the lord
And when I think of perfection, you know I'm thinking of your
Voice, when you tell me you don't call him your baby
Because that was the name that you rightfully gave me
And it's foolish to share with someone else
And my heart goes bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
</p>
<p>
But you admit that you're lonely, you're as cold as a statue
Pleading 'fuck me' on the marble that was used to create you
I can't stand that you're talking when you shouldn't be living
I didn't dodge all your bullets; just denied that they hit me
So when my body is bleeding, I won't admit that this hurts
Because admitting isn't fixing so then what is it worth?
So to say you're unhappy is like saying you're sorry
It's nothing that I care to hear
</p>
<p>
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
</P>
<p>
So now the tears in your jeans are the holes in your armor
You're the thoughts that I feared, you're the mountain I've conquered
If I told you I loved you, would you reach out and touch me?
You taste like the ocean and your body's disgusting
The only reason you breathe is to sleep through the night
The only reason you speak is to tell me I'm fine
The only reason you breathe is to sleep through the night
The only reason you speak is to state that you're mine
And my heart goes bum bum bum bum bum
